# ML System's development: common challenges

<p align="justify">
As once said by Renato Cordeiro on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBHelxMkt44">this meetup</a>: MLOps is the answer, but what's question? (translated from portuguese: MLOps é a resposta, mas qual é a pergunta?)
</p>

<p align="justify">
Most of the contents we find on the internet about MLOps are concentrated around tools, such as MLFlow, DVC, Kubeflow, and so on. They in fact are important (very important) since they try to minimize problems and to overcome challenges in ML projects. However, we must keep in mind that they are useless if we don't know what problems each of them solves and when we really have to use them.

In this section I present some of the challenges, problems, issues related to ML projects. You can find all sources in the resources section [###TODO].
